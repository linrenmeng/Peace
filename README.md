â€‹									  **Fig.1** The overall framework of PEACE

**Fig. 1** shows the overall framework of PEACE, which aims to opti-mize a target function and ensure the correctness and integrity of the overall project at the same time. To achieve this goal, PEACE first analyzes code contexts to construct an optimizing function se-quence to edit, and then identify valid associated edits. After that, it leverages valid associate edits along with both internal and externalhigh-performance functions to iteratively optimize the functionsin the optimizing function sequence. Specifically, PEACE containsthree main phases: Dependency-Aware Optimizing Function Se-quence Construction (Phase I),Valid Associated Edits Identification(Phase II), and Performance Editing Iteration (Phase III).
